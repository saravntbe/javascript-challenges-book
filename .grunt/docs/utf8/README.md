Copy and run, individually, the following lines of code in your console:

```
console.log( '#1:', 'mañana' === 'mañana' );
```

```
console.log( '#2:', 'mañana' === 'mañana' );
```

Why the first execution of console.log logs **#1: true**?

```js

```

```js
It logs true because the two words are the same characters.

Why the second execution of console.log logs **#2: false**?

```js

```

```js
It logs false because the encoding of characters and the character ñ contains( n and ̃ ) it's an issue with UTF8 encoding.
